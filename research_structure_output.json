    "research_question": "How can knowledge distillation mechanisms facilitate efficient knowledge transfer between diverse models and hardware setups in autonomous vehicles, particularly within a federated learning framework, to maintain model performance and adaptability when sensors or hardware change, without the need for full retraining or collecting extensive new datasets?",
    "hypothesis": "Knowledge distillation, when integrated into a federated learning framework, can efficiently transfer knowledge between heterogeneous AI models and hardware setups in autonomous vehicles, enabling model updates without full retraining or extensive new datasets, thereby maintaining model performance, adaptability, robustness, and inference efficiency.",
    "method": "The research involves the design, development, training, implementation, and evaluation of machine learning models, knowledge distillation methods, and federated learning mechanisms. It includes developing and implementing knowledge distillation pipelines, training and evaluating models under sensor and hardware shifts, developing and experimenting with a federated learning framework integrating distillation, and benchmarking against baseline models. Techniques used include knowledge distillation, federated machine learning, deep learning, and multimodal models. Experiments will be conducted in both simulations and real-world driving scenarios using tools like PyTorch, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, federated learning frameworks, and simulation environments.",
